<p>Here is an overview of the Haiku Code Drive 2008 program:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have come up with the following <a href="/community/haiku-code-drive-2008/applications">list of candidates and their projects</a> from the students that could not make it into the GSoC and expressed their desire to participate.</li>
<li>We asked the community to support the program by making donations to a common fund, and raised a total of approximately $7,500.</li>
<li>An <a href="/poll/2008-08-22/haiku_code_drive_2008_poll">open poll</a> was held so that the community could vote for the student/project they want the donated funds to go to.</li>
<li>Based on the results of the poll and the amount of donated funds, we <a href="/news/2008-05-30/haiku_code_drive_2008_to_sponsor_four_students">decided to sponsor four students</a> shown in the "Haiku Code Drive 2008 Projects" section below.</li>
<li>The selected candidates work on their projects, and in the end each receives a US$2,500 stipend (a milestone-based mid-term 50% payment is being considered).</ul>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>The Haiku Code Drive 2008 is a community-funded and driven effort that is being made possible by the support and participation of many people. This includes not only those who funded the program with their generous contributions (more than <a href="">120 people from 24 countries</a>), but also the people who helped spread the word during the donation drive and, needless to say, the Haiku developers that have volunteered their time to mentor the students for the duration of the program.</p>
