<p>The Haiku Code Drive is a program designed to raise funds from the community in order to sponsor students to produce code for Haiku. The Haiku Code Drive program specifically targets student candidates that applied for Haiku but could not make it into the Google Summer of Code. We are offering them a U$2,500 stipend per successfully completed project.</p>
