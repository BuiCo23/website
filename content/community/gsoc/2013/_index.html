<p>The Google Summer of Code&trade; 2013 is on! Haiku is proud to
be <strong>applying as Mentoring Organization</strong>!

Thanks goes to the participation of various individuals in the
community, particularly our <i>Google Summer of Code</i>
admin Matthew S. Madia and those who volunteered to become <a href="/community/gsoc/2013#mentors">Haiku mentors</a>.

If selected, 2013 marks the seventh consecutive year for Haiku as a mentoring organization.

Once again, we could be joining many open source projects chosen by Google to take part in this great program.</p>

<h3>Why does Haiku want to participate?</h3>

<p>The <i>Google Summer of Code</i> is a wonderful opportunity
for the Haiku Project. It exposes Haiku to many potential youthful
and energetic minds that are interested in developing Open Source Software.

Even more exciting, it provides a unique opportunity of generating
income for the Project while growing a handful of carefully selected
students into knowledgeable and potential long-term contributors.

As an open source project that develops an operating system, our
pool of active committers is relatively small and being able to
embrace new contributors is literally a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>As a mentoring organization, we balance selecting impressive students
(who display promise of becoming regular contributors) and useful projects
(which can be mentored and are appropriate for Haiku).</p>

<p>We strive to nurture our students into talented and motivated open-source
developers. This includes being able to communicate effectively on public
mailing lists, provide relevant information in bug reports, continually publish code for peer-review,
and perhaps most importantly, knowing when to ask for help. Those skills empower them with the
confidence and ability to continue making valued contributions to Haiku (or
any open source project for that matter).</p>


<h3>Current status of the program</h3>

<p>The Haiku developers have come up with a
<a href="/community/gsoc/2013/ideas">list of ideas</a>
for students to choose from or to base their proposals on. The candidate
<strong>students need to start discussing application ideas with Haiku
as soon as possible</strong>. The application period for students is
April 22nd to May 3rd. The list of accepted students, their projects, and mentors will be announced on May 27th (19:00 UTC).

<h3>Who are the Haiku mentors?</h3>
<p>Haiku utilizes a <strong>mentor pool</strong>,
as a compliment to the assigned mentor (and co-mentor) for each student.
The mentor pool allows additional people to provide support throughout the
<i>Google Summer of Code</i> program. Students who utilize the mentor pool
avoid bottlenecks that can happen, when responsibility would otherwise
depend on a single person inside a volunteer driven project. This also
helps to strenghten the students' ability and comfort with discussions
on an open mailing list, which is essential in many remote software development models.
A complete list of all Haiku mentors for <i>Google Summer of Code</i> 2013 is being compiled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruno Albuquerque</li>
<li>Stephan Aßmus</li>
<li>Andrew Bachmann</li>
<li>Adrien Destuges</li>
<li>Jérôme Duval</li>
<li>Axel Dörfler</li>
<li>Alexander von Gluck IV</li>
<li>Rene Gollent</li>
<li>Fredrik Holmqvist</li>
<li>Scott McCreary</li>
<li>Urias McCullough</li>
<li>Hamish Morrison</li>
<li>Joe Prostko</li>
<li>Niels Sascha Reedijk</li>
<li>John Scipione</li>

<h3>How you can help Haiku in <i>Google Summer of Code</i></h3>

<p>Even as a non-mentor, you can help by providing assistance
to the students on the mailing list and on the Haiku IRC channel.
Making the students feel comfortable with the community is important,
as it can help them do a better job at reaching their
<i>Google Summer of Code</i> goals, and could also be the key to
students staying with the project even after their
<i>Google Summer of Code</i> assignment is over.</p>
