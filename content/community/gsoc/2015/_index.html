<p>The Google Summer of Code&trade; 2015 is coming up soon - Haiku hopes to be accepted as Mentoring Organization once again!
This will hopefully be the eighth year, in which Haiku was selected to participate as one of the mentoring organizations.

<h3>Why does Haiku want to participate?</h3>

<p>The <i>Google Summer of Code</i> is a wonderful opportunity for the Haiku Project. It exposes Haiku to many potential youthful and energetic minds that are interested in developing Open Source Software.

Even more exciting, it provides a unique opportunity of generating income for the Project while growing a handful of carefully selected students into knowledgeable and potential long-term contributors.

As an open source project that develops an operating system, our pool of active committers is relatively small and being able to embrace new contributors is literally a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>As a mentoring organization, we balance selecting impressive students (who display promise of becoming regular contributors) and useful projects (which can be mentored and are appropriate for Haiku).</p>

<p>We strive to nurture our students into talented and motivated open-source developers. This includes being able to communicate effectively on public mailing lists, provide relevant information in bug reports, continually publish code for peer-review, and perhaps most importantly, knowing when to ask for help. Those skills empower them with the confidence and ability to continue making valued contributions to Haiku (or any open source project for that matter).</p>


<h3>Current status of the program</h3>

<p>The Haiku developers have come up with a
<a href="/community/gsoc/2015/ideas">list of ideas</a> for students to choose from or to base their proposals on. The candidate <strong>students need to start discussing application ideas with Haiku
as soon as possible</strong>. The application period for students is March 10th to March 21st. The list of accepted students, their projects, and mentors will be announced on April 21st (19:00 UTC).

<h3>Who are the Haiku mentors?</h3>
<p>Haiku utilizes a <strong>mentor pool</strong>, as a complement to the assigned mentor (and co-mentor) for each student. The mentor pool allows additional people to provide support throughout the <i>Google Summer of Code</i> program. Students who utilize the mentor pool avoid bottlenecks that can happen, when responsibility would otherwise depend on a single person inside a volunteer driven project. This also helps to strengthen the students' ability and comfort with discussions
on an open mailing list, which is essential in many remote software development models. A complete list of all Haiku mentors for <i>Google Summer of Code</i> 2015 is being compiled.</p>

<h3>How you can help Haiku in <i>Google Summer of Code</i></h3>

<p>Even as a non-mentor, you can help by providing assistance to the students on the mailing list and on the Haiku IRC channel. Making the students feel comfortable with the community is important,
as it can help them do a better job at reaching their <i>Google Summer of Code</i> goals, and could also be the key to students staying with the project even after their <i>Google Summer of Code</i> assignment is over.</p>
