<p>The Google Summer of Code&trade; 2010 is on! We are proud to once again be taking part in it! Thanks to the participation of various individuals in the community, particularly our <i>Google Summer of Code</i> admin Matthew S. Madia and those who volunteered to become mentors, we are excited on being accepted as a mentor organization for this fourth year in a row. Once again, we would be joining <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2010">many open source projects</a> chosen by Google to take part in this great program.</p>

<h3>What is the Google Summer of Code and why does Haiku want to participate?</h3>

<p>The <i>Google Summer of Code</i> is a program that offers students stipends to write code for open source projects. Participation in this program gives Haiku an opportunity to have one or more developers that contribute to our code base for a period of three months. It also can help grow our pool of developers, as it is not uncommon for the participating students to stay with the project after the program is completed. Finally, it raises our visibility in the open source world, something that can have a positive effect in raising the profile of the project.</p>

<h3>Current status of the program</h3>

<p>The Haiku developers have come up with a <a href="/community/gsoc/2010/ideas">list of ideas</a> for students to choose from or to base their proposals on. The candidate students need to start discussing application ideas with Haiku as soon as possible. The application period for students is March 29 to April 9. All student proposals will be matched with a mentor by April 21, and the final list of accepted students and their projects will be announced on April 26 (12 noon US PDT).
