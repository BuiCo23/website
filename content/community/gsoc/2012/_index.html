<p><strong>The Google Summer of Code&trade; 2012 is on! Haiku is proud to 
be a Mentoring Organization!</strong>

Thanks goes to the participation of various individuals in the
community, particularly our <i>Google Summer of Code</i>
admin Matthew S. Madia and those who volunteered to become <a href="/community/gsoc/2012#mentors">Haiku mentors</a>.

2012 marks the sixth consecutive year for Haiku as a mentoring organization.

Once again, we are joining <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2012">180 open source projects chosen by Google</a> to take part in this great program.</p>

<h3>Why does Haiku want to participate?</h3>

<p>The <i>Google Summer of Code</i> is a wonderful opportunity 
for the Haiku Project. It exposes Haiku to many potential youthful
and energetic minds that are interested in developing Open Source Software.

Even more exciting, it provides a unique opportunity of generating
income for the Project while growing a handful of carefully selected
students into knowledgeable and potential long-term contributors.

As an open source project that develops an operating system, our 
pool of active committers is relatively small and being able to 
embrace new contributors is literally a wonderful thing.</p>

<p>As a mentoring organization, we balance selecting impressive students 
(who display promise of becoming regular contributors) and useful projects
(which can be mentored and are appropriate for Haiku).</p>

<p>We strive to nurture our students into talented and motivated open-source
developers. This includes being able to communicate effectively on public 
mailing lists, provide relevant information in bug reports and perhaps most 
importantly, knowing when to ask for help. Those skills empower them with the 
confidence and ability to continue making valued contributions to Haiku (or 
any open source project for that matter).</p>


<h3>Current status of the program</h3>

<p>The Haiku developers have come up with a 
<a href="/community/gsoc/2012/ideas">list of ideas</a>
for students to choose from or to base their proposals on. The candidate 
<strong>students need to start discussing application ideas with Haiku 
as soon as possible</strong>. The application period for students is 
March 26 to April 6. All student proposals will be matched with a mentor by April 20, 
and the final list of accepted students and their projects will be announced on April 23 (12 noon US PDT).

<h3>Who are the Haiku mentors?</h3>
<p>Haiku utilizes a <strong>mentor pool</strong>, 
as a compliment to the assigned mentor (and co-mentor) for each student.
The mentor pool allows additional people to provide support throughout the 
<i>Google Summer of Code</i> program. Students who utilize the mentor pool 
avoid bottlenecks that can happen, when responsibility would otherwise 
depend on a single person inside a volunteer driven project. This also 
helps to strenghten the students' ability and comfort with discussions 
on an open mailing list, which is essential in many remote software development models. 
Here is a complete list of all Haiku mentors for <i>Google Summer of Code</i> 2012:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bruno Albuquerque</li>
<li>Stephan Aßmus</li>
<li>Adrien Destugues</li>
<li>Jérôme Duval</li>
<li>Axel Dörfler</li>
<li>Alexander von Gluck</li>
<li>René Gollent</li>
<li>Fredrik Holmqvist</li>
<li>Scott McCreary</li>
<li>Urias McCullough</li>
<li>Joe Prostko</li>
<li>Niels Reedijk</li>
<li>Oliver Ruiz Dorantes</li>
<li>Philippe Saint-Pierre</li>
<li>Ingo Weinhold</li>
<li>Alex Wilson</li>
<li>Siarzhuk Zharski</li>
<li>Clemens Zeidler</li>
</ul>


<h3>How you can help Haiku in <i>Google Summer of Code</i></h3>

<p>Even as a non-mentor, you can help by providing assistance 
to the students on the mailing list and on the Haiku IRC channel. 
Making the students feel comfortable with the community is important, 
as it can help them do a better job at reaching their 
<i>Google Summer of Code</i> goals, and could also be the key to 
students staying with the project even after their 
<i>Google Summer of Code</i> assignment is over.</p>
