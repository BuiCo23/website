<p>This year 5 students worked on our projects, of which 3 succesfully completed the program.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/blog/andrej_spielmann/">Andrej Spielmann</a> - Subpixel antialiased rendering in app_server</li>
	<li><a href="/blog/dustin_howett/">Dustin Howett</a> - HPET timers support</li>
	<li><a href="/blog/upczhsh/">Zhao Shuai</a> - Swap file support</li>
	<li><a href="/blog/alex_roman/">Alexandru Roman</a> - Zeroconf support (student resigned because of lack of time)</li>
	<li>Adrien Lemaire - CIFS support (failed - no code delivered)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, 4 more students were paid directly by Haiku as part of the
"Haiku Code Drive", as there were several promising students and only 5 GSoC
slots</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/blog/emitrax/">Salvatore Benedetto</a> - Bonnie++ port, UFS filesystem, BFS debugging, XSI semaphores and message queues support</li>
	<li>Jovan Ivankovic - CUPS port and integration (student resigned due to health issues)</li>
	<li>Yin Qiu - ICMP error handling and propagation</li>
	<li><a href="/blog/absabs/">JiSheng Zhang</a> - FireWire support (continuation of his GSoC 2007 project)</li>
</ul>
