<p>
Haiku includes a partition editor which allows you to properly create a partition for Haiku. If your disk does not have any available space for Haiku and you wish to keep your current disk contents, it is recommended to utilize a 3rd party partition editor such as <a href='http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php' target='_blank'>GParted</a> to resize your existing partitions.
