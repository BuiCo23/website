<p>Haiku is proud to once again be part of the Google Summer of Code.
Over the summer, students will work on improving Haiku
and related applications, with help from our mentor team. Google gives the
students a stipend, which allows them to work full-time on the project without
the need to find another job.</p>

<p>The goal of the program is to introduce students to the way open source
projects work, and encourage them to become long term contributors. Several
members of the Haiku developer team are indeed former GSoC students.</p>

<p>If you know people in the right age bracket that might be interested, point them
to the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code site</a> that has all the relevant information.
Or print out our <a href="/community/gsoc">GSoC flyer</a> and hand them out on campus.</p>

<p>The student application window starts March 12, however students should start
discussing their project for the summer before then.
The coding period spans over May, June, and July.</p>
